A simple JavaScript-based web application that allows users to download entire GitHub repositories or specific folders from repositories, even without specifying a folder path.

Features
Download an entire GitHub repository or specific folders.
Option to handle private repositories with user notification.
Automatically downloads the repository's main folder if no folder path is specified.
How It Works
Enter the GitHub repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/user/repo).
(Optional) Specify a folder path within the repository to download. If no folder path is provided, the root folder of the repository will be downloaded.
The program constructs the GitZip API URL based on the user input and provides a direct link to download the repository or folder.
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Ajaygithub2001/gitclonedownload.git
Open the index.html file in your browser.

Enter a GitHub repository URL and optionally a folder path.

Click the "Download Repository or Folder" button.

Example
To download the root folder of a repository:
URL: https://github.com/user/repo
Folder Path: Leave blank (or /)
To download a specific folder:
URL: https://github.com/user/repo
Folder Path: /path/to/folder
